Simon Says Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic electronic memory game "Simon Says." It's built with  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must memorize and repeat.The sequence grows longer with each successful level, increasing the difficulty.

🎮 How to Play
Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
The game will flash the first color in the sequence.
Click the button corresponding to the color you saw.
If you are correct, the game will progress to the next level, adding a new color to the end of the sequence.
If you make a mistake, a "wrong" sound will play, a "Game Over" message will be displayed, and the game will reset.
See how many levels you can complete!

✨ Features
Progressive Difficulty: The color sequence increases in length by one with each successfully completed level.
Visual Feedback: Buttons flash to indicate the game's sequence and when the player clicks them. The "active" class provides smooth visual feedback using CSS transitions.
Audio Feedback: A unique sound plays for each color button. A separate "wrong" sound plays when the player makes a mistake.
State Tracking: The game tracks the current level, the game's sequence, and the player's input sequence.
Clear UI: A status display shows the current level or "Game Over" messages.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the game, including the main container, title, color buttons, start button, and status display.
CSS: Styles the game with a dark theme. It uses Flexbox to center the game and arrange the buttons.
JavaScript (ES6+): Controls all game logic, including state management, event handling, and DOM manipulation.


🧠 Core Logic & Technical Highlights
This project is built on a few key JavaScript concepts:

1. State Management
The game's state is managed by three core variables.
gameSequence: An array that stores the sequence of colors generated by the game.
playerSequence: An array that tracks the player's button inputs for the current level.
level: A counter for the current game level.

2. Sequence Generation
The nextSequence() function is called to progress the game.
It increments the level, updates the status text , and uses Math.random() to select a random color ID.
This new color is pushed onto the gameSequence array.

3. User Input & Event Handling
Event listeners are attached to each color button.
When a button is clicked, its color ID is added to the playerSequence.
The checkAnswer() function is immediately called to validate the input.

4. Answer Validation
The checkAnswer(currentLevel) function compares the player's most recent input in playerSequence against the corresponding item in gameSequence.
If incorrect: The game plays a "wrong" sound, displays a "Game Over" message, and resets the game state.
If correct: The function checks if the playerSequence length matches the gameSequence length.
If yes, the player has completed the level. The game waits for a short delay (using setTimeout) and then calls nextSequence() to start the next level.
If no, the game simply waits for the player's next input.

5. Asynchronous Behavior
setTimeout() is used to create small, non-blocking delays. This is crucial for:
Flashing the buttons: The active class is added and then removed after 300ms.
Pacing the game: A delay is added after the player successfully completes a sequence before the game shows the next sequence.
